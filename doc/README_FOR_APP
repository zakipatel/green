Use this README file to introduce your application and point to useful places in the API for learning more.
Run "rake doc:app" to generate API documentation for your models, controllers, helpers, and libraries.

THESE ARE THE MODELS

1. USER has a LOGIN
2. USER has a ACCOUNT
3. ACCOUNT has many TRANSACTIONS PERFORMED USING METHODS (NEW, LOAD, HISTORY, TRANSFER, SUSPEND, CLOSE .. )
4. TRANSACTIONS CREATE FOOTPRINTS (PIN, TIME, LOCATION, ACCOUNT, STATUS, CATEGORY. .. )
5. USERS load ACCOUNTS with TRANSACTIONS
6. TRANSACTIONS get UPDATED (i.e user#load --> increases balance)

.. notion of 'bank' .. need to know "supply or value of transactions in customers hands
vs. in retail/distribution - this is equal or should be equal to the 'value that has been printed' .. or whatever is printed is either active' or inactive'

if its active, that means its either in the MARKET or with the CONSUMER. 

through sales and dist , we keep track of what is ISSUED in the market (both PINs and VLAUE! If its ISSUED, its IN MARKET

we get REGULAR updates of the SOLD IN MARKET PINs  (and implicitly the 'value'), sold in the market (daily? weekly, monthly). 

There is a lag.  

CONSUMERS can ACTIVATE ASAP --> IN MARKET/ACTIVE 

Whereas, IN MARKET/SOLD  might happen after the fact 

If in market, customer can activate
Once customer activates, it can be redeemed 

We use this to control 
- What is PRINTED (pins and values) - these are not issued
- What we ISSUE (pins and value) - this issues (ready for sales, distribution, retail)
- What is IN MARKET (pins and value) - printed PINS are IN MARKET (i.e. ready to be made ACTIVE)  
- What is ACTIVE (by consumers) - done via sms, web, phone. these are ready to REDEEM  
- What is reported SOLD (by sales, retail and distribution). this is afterthefact. use this for the vendor portal to track what is OWED IN CASH (tie the 'notion of bank')

- WHAT IS CONSUMED - i.e. used on E-COMMERCE by CONSUMERS. 
- PAYMENT PLUG IN gets ETAILER SALES - use this for e-tailer portal
